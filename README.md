## Create custom elements

You can customize and create custom elements in your page.  
In order to do that, you can check the [Rich Editor custom element creation](https://github.com/monsieurbiz/SyliusRichEditorPlugin#create-your-own-elements)

## SEO Friendly

You can define for every page the meta title, meta description and meta 
keywords.

## Troubleshooting

### Locale not found

We've added a new LocaleContext (`LastChanceLocaleContext`) because the locale isn't set in the request when the
condition on the route is applied.  
Therefore, if you still have an issue with multiple locales in your project, you may need to add another LocaleContext
in order to find out your locale. The system will take care of the rest.
